44187121,75389161,Marvin,Ole V.V.,2,2017-05-25 18:42:48.740000,2,Good answer. I think I’d use `for (Month month : Month.values())`. I might also require a `DayOfWeek` enum constant (or convert to one) so I avoided the `getDisplayName()` call in each iteration.,"{'Month.values', 'DayOf', 'DayOfWeek', 'for (Month month : Month.values())', 'getDisplayName()', 'getDisplay', 'Month.values()', 'values()'}",True,"[(2, {'Month.values()', 'Month.values', 'values()'})]",3,0,
44187121,75389309,Marvin,Marvin,3,2017-05-25 18:47:37.060000,0,@OleV.V. Thought about using `Month` but didn't see the second `of` method until just now - will change it. The ugly `getDisplayName()` is kind of on purpose to keep it in line with the original comparison. But I agree that an enum would be the better choice.,"{'getDisplayName()', 'Month', 'of', 'getDisplay'}",True,,3,0,

The original code could have required or converted to `Calendar.SUNDAY` and used `cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK)`, but didn’t, so your code is more in line with how it did.","{'Calendar.DAY', 'Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK', 'cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK)', 'get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK)', 'Calendar.SUNDAY', 'cal.get'}",True,,2,0,
