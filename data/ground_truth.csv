thank you so much for your help!! Thats unbelievable. I don't know how many days I would have spent on this without your help. 

The only thing which seems more complicated that I thought it would be, is to get an output in German. 

I like this format `('D, j.n.', strtotime(""+$start days""))` a lot. But a simple add of `setlocale(LC_TIME, ""de_DE"");` won't work. And replace all the strtotime with strftime doesn't work too.
