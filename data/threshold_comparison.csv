32772686,heisian,heisian,"@DanHunsaker Well, here's the framework source for where helpers are defined: https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/master/src/Illuminate/Foundation/helpers.php
No namespacing, so this file is loaded somewhere in Laravel without the help of the `ClassLoader`.. so to extend these types of functions the way to do it would be as others have said is to do a manual `require` or `include`. I don't know though, some people's obsession is with being able to call `myGlobalFunction()` whereas my obsession is `VerySpecificClass::method()`..

32772686,heisian,Dan Hunsaker,"Yeah, I dug through the framework once and found where they pulled the helpers in. And again, I completely agree that methods of namespaced static classes are a much cleaner fit than what's being requested - or recommended - most of the time. The fact is, helpers aren't really The Laravel Way in the first place, but rather a holdover from CodeIgniter 2.x that still hasn't been phased out.
